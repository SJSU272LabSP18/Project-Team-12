# Utopia: An Alexa skill that helps with depression

Utopia is the name of the Alexa skill that is designed to help people with depression.


## What is Utopia?

***Libellus vere aureus, nec minus salutaris quam festivus, de optimo rei publicae statu deque nova insula Utopia***

The term was first coined by Thomas More (1478â€“1535), and was originally a fictional book
written in Latin that described a perfect world. 

The original title of the book is shown above, and translates to, "A truly golden little book, no less beneficial than entertaining, 
of a republic's best state and of the new island Utopia"

## What is it meant for?

This skill is meant to help with people who are clinically and periodically depressed mainly 
but also people who are just having a bad day by talking to them, providing natural solutions, 
such as going out, exercising, talking to family or friends, motivating them, and possibly explaining to them 
what they are going through. This Alexa skill will respond with basic human responses, 
such as giving simple advice and suggestions. 

This can have a great impact in decreasing suicide rates, 
helping with clinically depressed people, and motivating them to get up and go on with their day. 
Sometimes all a person needs is to talk to someone, and why not a virtual assistant who can talk back?

**Disclaimer**: Utopia is not meant to be a cure, but a helper to depression. The people who programmed this are not experts in mental illnesses such as depression,
and this is a product of our subjectivity and couple months of basic research (mostly via Google) on depression.

## Description

Utopia is powered by Python, [Flask-Ask](http://flask-ask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and the Alexa Skills kit.

## How to use
To start using it, say a simple invocation phrase, such as the following listed below:
