# Utopia: An Alexa skill that helps with depression

Utopia is the name of the Alexa skill that is designed to help people with depression. 

## Description
**Disclaimer**: Utopia is not meant to be a cure, but a helper to depression. The people who programmed this are not experts in mental illnesses such as depression,
and this is a product of our subjectivity and  couple months of basic research (mostly via Google) on depression.

Utopia is powered by Python, Flask-Ask, and the Alexa Skills kit.

## To Be Continued...
I will add more to this as I get farther into the project.
